Prefect technical details
=========================

Components of the deployment
----------------------------

Our Prefect deployment consists of multiple components. The most important ones are:

- Apollo: the main endpoint for interacting with the server
- UI: the user interface that provides a visual dashboard for mutating and querying metadata
- Agent: this is the part that actually executes the flows
