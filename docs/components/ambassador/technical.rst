Ambassador technical details
============================

Ambassador is a Kubernetes-native API Gateway built on the Envoy Proxy. In addition to
the classical routing capabilities of an ingress, it can perform sophisticated traffic
management functions, such as load balancing, circuit breakers, rate limits, and automatic retries.
Also, it has support for independent authentication systems, such as the ORY ecosystem.
